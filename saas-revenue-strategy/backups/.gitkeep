# Backups Directory

This directory stores Milvus vector database snapshots.

## Usage

Backups are created with:
```bash
python scripts/backup_vector_db.py
```

Backups are restored with:
```bash
python scripts/restore_vector_db.py --input ./backups/milvus_snapshot.tar.gz
```

## Git Storage

Vector database snapshots can be versioned in Git for reproducibility.
However, be mindful of file sizes and Git LFS usage for large snapshots.
